            THIS APPLICATION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENTLY FOR TESTING ONLY! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

            THIS APPLICATION MODIFIES THE WEIGHT, WEIGHT SPECTRUM, FLAG, AND FLAG_ROW COLUMNS OF THE INPUT
            MS. IF YOU WANT A PRISTINE COPY OF THE INPUT MS TO BE PRESERVED, MAKE A COPY OF IT BEFORE
            RUNNING THIS APPLICATION.

            This application computes weights for the WEIGHT and WEIGHT_SPECTRUM (if present) columns
            based on the variance of values in the CORRECTED_DATA column. If the MS has no CORRECTED_DATA
            column, the application will fail.  The following algorithm is used:
 
            1. For unflagged data, create two sets of values, one set is composed solely of the real part
               of the data values, the other set is composed solely of the imaginary part of the data
               values.
            2. Compute the variance of each of these sets, vr and vi.
            3. Compute veq = (vr + vi)/2.
            4. The associated weight is just the reciprocal of veq. The weight will have unit
               of (data unit)^(-2), eg Jy^(-2).

            Data are aggregated on a per-baseline basis. Data are aggregated in bins determined by the
            specified value of the timebin parameter. If the value of timebin is an integer, it means
            that that value should be multiplied by the representative integration time in the MS. This
            integration is the median value of all the values in the INTERVAL column. Flags are not
            considered in the integration time computation. If either extrema in the INTERVAL column
            differs from the median by more than 25%, the application will fail because the values vary
            too much for there to be a single, representative, integration time. The timebin parameter
            can also be specified as a quantity (string) that must have time conformant units.
            
            The time bins are not necessarily contiguous and are not necessarily the same width. The start
            of a bin is always coincident with a value from the TIME column, So for example, if values
            from the time column are [20, 60, 100, 140, 180, 230], and the width of the bins is chosen to be 110s,
            the first bin would start at 20s and run to 130s, so that data from timestamps 20, 60,
            and 100 will be included in the first bin. The second bin would start
            at 140, so that data for timestamps 140, 180, and 230 would be included in the second bin.
            Also, time binning does not span scan boundaries, so that data associated with different
            scan numbers will always be binned separately; changes in SCAN_NUMBER will cause a new time
            bin to be created, with its starting value coincident with the time of the new SCAN_NUMBER.
            Similar behavior can be expected for changes in FIELD_ID and ARRAY_ID.
            
            Flagged values are not used in computing the weights, although the associated weights of
            these values are updated.

            If the variance for a set of data is 0, all associated flags for that data are set to True,
            and the corresponding weights are set to 0.

        EXAMPLE 
        
        # update the weights of an MS using time binning of 300s
        statwt2("my.ms", timebin="300s")
